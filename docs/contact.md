# Now, all of this is great and all, but who are you?

Well, I put this page in to answer those questions, since I'm sure you're wondering.

No, I did **NOT** develop the script, or any of the associated applications. 

And I **DO NOT** want to claim the fame. The two nerds [qwery26](https://github.com/qwery26) and [riboribo](https://github.com/riboribo) made the script that does all the work, I personally don't find myself fond of programming, but I can do it in small doses for giggles.

Instead, I wrote a wonderful guide for those who get stuck, or want a set of thoroughly-detailed instructions for performing the modification to their phone(s).
<br>I also contributed by providing QA/testing on the process, as I own two MC74 unit(s) and could provide testing. This also unearthed that there are two different variants of the phones which lead to further developments in the project.

I also started the community on [Reddit](https://reddit.com/r/ReviveMC74), which started my involvement in the project. The only reaason that I believe that I'm on the Github as a contributor is because I contributed to the community aspect of ReviveMC74.

I love the project, as it provides an outlet for me to learn new things. It's taught me deep ADB commands, Python, Markdown, how to manage a subreddit, and much more.

I (Phoenix, Jacob W.) personally took the time to QA / test, break, experiment and write this, and the other guides on the subreddit. 

I'm from Saint Louis, Missouri. And I'm currently on the tail-end of my Associates degree in Computer Systems Administration. I have a CCENT, MD-100, and I'm working towards my CCNA.
