You've opened up a multitude of possibilities for your shiny new Meraki-MC74 by successfully getting here! There's so many options to focus on, but primarily, I'm going to focus on configuring the wPhone (LinPhone) application for communication with a SIP/PBX server. Configuring wPhone to communicate with a 3CX SIP server: Now, I understand that not everyone uses 3CX but I prefer it over most other SIP / PBX servers as it's easy to configure and the license is pretty much free to use. Open the wPhone application. It should present you with an assisted menu to put your credentials into. Your credentials are translated as presented below: Username: Extension (001) Password: Extension Password (NOT YOUR 3CX PASSWORD) Domain: Your 3CX domain ({yourname}.3cx.us, 192.168.1.x, voip.phoenix.lab) Display Name: Optional, but looks nice in the side-bar as a title. Transport: TCP (Or TLS if you have that configured.) Now, it won't work out of the box, because 3CX is special, so hit the hamburger button in the upper-left corner and tap your display name. It should open a menu titled SIP ACCOUNT . On the right, under Auth userid put your extension username. Under Proxy add your SIP port after your domain so it looks something like: Under Prefix remove the prefix, otherwise it'll try to dial with a +1 on everything. Switch to the Network tab. Switch Use Random Ports to OFF . Under SIP Port put 9000 . Switch to the Call tab. Configure a ringtone, or don't. I don't care. Switch to the Audio tab. Go ham, turn on all the codecs. In 3CX, under the extension, and under Phone Provisioning scroll to the bottom and look under codecs. Click Add codecs and add them all. On the phone again, press the dialpad button and tap the status indicator next to the hamburger icon, this instructs it to attempt to connect. It should connect if your setup matches mine. Congratulations! Configuring wPhone with a Asterisk SIP/PBX server: I don't have one of these, but I'm sure one of you out there do, so please message me with further information.

Well, I put this page in to answer those questions, since I'm sure you're wondering. No, I did NOT develop the script, or any of the associated applications. And I DO NOT want to claim the fame. The two nerds qwery26 and riboribo made the script that does all the work, I personally don't find myself fond of programming, but I can do it in small doses for giggles. Instead, I wrote a wonderful guide for those who get stuck, or want a set of thoroughly-detailed instructions for performing the modification to their phone(s). I also contributed by providing QA/testing on the process, as I own two MC74 unit(s) and could provide testing. This also unearthed that there are two different variants of the phones which lead to further developments in the project. I also started the community on Reddit , which started my involvement in the project. The only reaason that I believe that I'm on the Github as a contributor is because I contributed to the community aspect of ReviveMC74. I love the project, as it provides an outlet for me to learn new things. It's taught me deep ADB commands, Python, Markdown, how to manage a subreddit, and much more.

After doing all of that work, I'm sure you're dying to know if you can set custom ringtones, backgrounds, etc. Well, the answer is yes, absolutely! After completing intial configuration, (i.e. Connecting to a SIP/PBX server, ensuring phonecalls can be recieved and made, etc.) you can further customize and brand your phone in the following ways: You can change the ringtone to be any .ogg file, just use an online converter to convert it! You can change the background on the dialer, as well as the clock to be whatever you want. You can change the timeout before the phone transitions to clock-mode, and idle/sleep mode. Changing the ringtone To change the ringtone, perform the following steps; Ensure your ringtone of choice is in the .ogg file format, as other formats are untested. If your ringtone is not in the .ogg file format, you can convert it using a tool, like this one . Establish an ADB connection to your phone, note that the location we will be using to store your ringtone will be /sdcard/ssm/audio/ . Copy your desired ringtone from your PC to your phone using the following command: adb shell push /path/to/ringtone.ogg /sdcard/ssm/audio/ringtone.ogg Pull the configuration file from the phone using the following command: adb shell pull /sdcard/ssm/store/MC74.mp C:/path/to/desired/location/MC74.mp . Now's a great time to remove the old MC74.nob if you've previously modified your phone and you're updating / now customizing. Run: adb shell rm /sdcard/ssm/store/MC74.nob Open up your text editor of choice, and locate the line that says ringtone: '/system/media/audio/ringtones/Trad.ogg' and change it to ringtone: '/sdcard/ssm/audio/yourringtone.ogg' Now push it back to the phone: adb shell push C:/path/to/desired/location/MC74.mp /sdcard/ssm/store/MC74.nob . Reboot your phone, or force-close and reopen wPhone from your home menu. Your changes should now be applied. Changing the wallpaper To change the wallpaper behind the dialer, perform the following steps; Ensure your wallpaper is in 16:9 and at least 720p (1280x720). Establish an ADB connection to your phone, note that the location we will be using to store your wallpaper will be /sdcard/ssm/image/ Copy your desired wallpaper from your PC to your phone using the following command: adb shell push /path/to/wallpaper.png /sdcard/ssm/image/wallpaper.png Pull the configuration file from the phone using the following command: adb shell pull /sdcard/ssm/store/MC74.mp C:/path/to/desired/location/MC74.mp Open up your text editor of choice, and locate the line that says bg: 'whiteSlate.jpg' Change that to bg: 'wallpaper.png' Note: To also change the wallpaper on the clock, find img: \"row.jpg\" under screensaver: and change it out with img: \"wallpaper.png\" Push the configuration file from your PC to your phone using the following command: adb shell push C:/path/to/desired/location/MC74.mp /sdcard/ssm/store/MC74.mp Reboot your phone, or force-close and reopen wPhone from your home menu. Your changes should now be applied. Changing the clock/sleep timers To change the clock/sleep timers, perform the following steps; Establish an ADB connection to your phone. Pull the configuration file from the phone using the following command: adb shell pull /sdcard/ssm/store/MC74.mp C:/path/to/desired/location/MC74.mp Open up your text editor of choice, and locate the line(s) that say lightSleep: '600' and deepSleep: '1200' Change them as desired, I personally recommend 10 minutes (600) lightSleep, and 60 minutes (3600) deepSleep.

I wondered, like most of you are, if you can make this thing a \"Discord Phone\" because everyone needs one of those, right? OF COURSE YOU CAN! It's a bit insecure since it's an older build of Discord, but it works! To install, perform the following: Ensure the phone is connected to your PC via USB. Ensure you have ADB access to your phone.

Let's start with the basics What do you need? A copy of the repository in a local directory: git clone https://github.com/reviveMC74/reviveMC74.git cd reviveMC74 A USB-A <-> USB-A cable (Amazon) A Meraki MC74 Cloud Phone (A-duh, that's why you're here) A way to power the phone, either via PoE (Power over Ethernet) or 12v adapter A computer with Python3 installed, preferibly Python27 for compatability reasons I Personally recommend installing Debian in a VM and passing the ADB interface through to it. I've found it easier to get the dependancies listed in the installer this way. The directions to get a VM with Debian running are outside the scope of this guide, but you can google it. The dependancies listed in the installer: UNPACKBOOTIMG/MKBOOTIMG/CPIO/CHMOD GZIP/GUNZIP Extract usr/local/wbin/gunzip.exe and usr/local/wbin/gzip.exe from that download and place in a PATH directory. A reasonable amount of experience with ADB (Android Debug Bridge) Preparing the phone After you've gathered the required components / software, you need to perform the following to get started: These steps put the phone into fastboot, allowing you to flash a custom recovery. Remove the USB cable from the side of the MC74 (If you've already connected it previously.) Remove the ethernet/PoE cable from the LAN port on the back of the MC74 Reconnect the USB cable to the right-side USB port of the MC74 (Not the back) and the other end to your PC Before you move onto the next step, be prepared to do the following after continuing: Press and hold the mute button (before the backlight flashes) Keep pressing it until the Cisco / Meraki logo appears and the vibrator audibly sounds Apply power with your PoE ethernet cable to the LAN port (It looks like a LAN icon, not the PC icon port.) Release the mute button after step 3-B occurs. If the phone boots like normal, you've done something wrong and must try again. Please return to step 1. Option 1: Running the script Now that the phone is ready, we can finally run the script! BUT, hold your horses, we have a few ways of doing it depending on how you installed Python: From inside the reviveMC74-main directory, type: - C:\\python27\\python.exe revive-Mc74.py - Or python revive-Mc74.py It should run as desired, and give a few more prompts. Just follow them as directed. When finished, you should have a modded MC74! Open the app drawer and tap wPhone and configure as desired. Don't worry if something breaks when running the script, not everyone's phone is built the same, so the script may fail in some places and succeed in others. The following options are for you! Option 2: replaceRecovery Failure Let's say the script failed after flashing recovery and now your phone is just sitting there in CWM, there's a way to manually do the rest of the work. My first phone failed here, and I had to do a bunch of tinkering to the /system partition to get it to allow access to ADB. Let's skip that and flash a pre-built image instead that I built from my phone: Download the following .zip file which is a backup of my /system partition, preconfigured to allow ADB access upon boot, and already has the Meraki dialer pre-uninstalled. From CWM, press install zip from sideload In your ADB shell type adb sideload {directory/to/downloaded/zip} After it pushes and restores, wipe /data and /cache to prevent potential issues. Reboot to system. When it boots, it may look like it's \"bootlooping\" but it should be operational, ensure the device has vibrated as that is an indicator of a successful boot. Then, run the script with the following arguments: python revive-Mc74.py installApps That should install (and uninstall if I missed anything) the custom dialer, led controls, and button redirections. From there, just press and hold the mute button and it should prompt you to pick a home application, choose TeslaLauncher and be sure to hit Always . And finally, from the app drawer run wPhone to get started on setting up your SIP softphone. Again, don't worry if that doesn't work either, there's always an option 3. Option 3: installApps Failure So, you've got CWM flashed to recovery, you've flashed my custom /system backup, or you've managed to get through the script up until this point, and now you're stuck: This is how my second phone failed, and here's how I manually did the work: Ensure you have ADB access to the phone (It's booted, and sitting on the Cisco Meraki screen, or you're on the homescreen.) from the /installFiles subdirectory, run the following: adb install com.teslacoilsw.launcher-4.1.0-41000-minAPI16.apk adb install -t revive.MC74-debug.apk adb install revive.SSMService-debug.apk adb root adb remount adb push hex /system/bin/hex adb shell chmod 755 /system/bin/hex adb push lights /system/bin/lights adb shell chmod 755 /system/bin/hex From there, you should be able to reboot the phone, and then run an application called wPhone from the launcher drawer.","title":"Setup"},{"location":"setup/#inital-setup","text":"Well, we have to start somewhere right?
